# Fifteen_test
##### This repository contains a jupyter notebook file in which I created a dataset column by column for fifteen technical test. The dataset can be find in the csv. file in this repository.
###### In the code I built a mathematical model with 5 factors to simulate the number of users. Then I simulated the number of trips, total travelled distance and time step by step. During the process I used another DataFrame to store some helpful transitional data. I used different distributions to estimate different data.
