# Fifteen_test
##### This repository contains a jupyter notebook file "fifteen_test" in which I created a dataset column by column for fifteen technical test. The dataset can be find in the csv file "test_dataset.csv" in this repository.
###### In the code I built a mathematical model with 5 factors to simulate the number of users. Then I simulated the number of trips, total travelled distance and time step by step. During the process I used another DataFrame to store some helpful transitional data. I used different distributions to estimate different data.

## I updated a new file "fifteen_test_Covid" in which I took the influence of Covid (2 periods of containments) into account. The csv fileof new version "test_dataset_Covid.csv" is also included.
